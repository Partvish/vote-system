# The Application
The application is a basic single page front-end application. It represents a basic online voting application for a fictional country, where the user can cast their vote if they have their pre-sent unique identification key.

The application has 3 pages in total: 
- The index page - where you have a direct link to the other two
- The voting page - a voting page, where you can order the candidates and cast your vote
- The results page - where you can see the current result of the election with a diagram

# Starting the application
The first time you open the the source folder, the node_modules will be missing. First they must be installed:
```
npm install
``` 

After that starting the application is fairly simple:

```
npm start
```
# Creating the application
The time needed to the create this simple application is kind of hard to count. It wasn't done in one session, rather a series of half to one hour runs.

- The basic functionality of the application took around 4 hours to implement.
- Understanding, comparing 3rd party libraries took around 3 hours.
- I'm used to using 3rd party Ui kits for building visuals in my application, writing it in pure CSS took more time than I expected, it was around 3 hours.

Creating the whole application took around 8-10 hours.
